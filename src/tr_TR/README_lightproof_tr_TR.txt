Turkish grammar checker

lightproof-tr is grammar checker dedicated to the Turkish language, derived from Lightproof. lightproof-tr aims at helping to write a proper Turkish without distracting users with false positives. This grammar checker follows the principle: the less false positives, the better; if it can not know with a good chance if a dubious expression is wrong, it will keep silent.
