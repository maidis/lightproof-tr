== Build OOo/LibO extension ==

Requirements: Python 3.3 or later. Building:

python make.py [config_file]

For example:

python make.py src/en/en.cfg

or with own Python 3.3 of LibreOffice, on Windows:

[install_path]\program\python make.py src\en\en.cfg

or on Linux (libreoffice.org distribution):

/opt/libreoffice4.1/program/python make.py src/en/en.cfg

The result is an oxt (OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice) extension.

1. Via Tools -> Extension manager in OOo/LibreOffice

2. or with unopkg tool, for example

[install_path\program\]unopkg add -f lightproof_en-0.4.2.oxt

  the result of the generation is a single Lightproof or vendor specific
